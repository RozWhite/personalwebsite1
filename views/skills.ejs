        <h3 class="skill_1">Artificial Intelligence</h3>
        <p>I decided to study AI and machine learning because I was involved in an AI-based decision making process 
          in my previous job and I found this field quit interesting. I got the chance to and continue my studies in Artificial Intelligence and Software Engineering Technology, 
          which was one of the best decisions in my life. I learned how to use machine learning, deep learning and NLP techniques 
          for different applications.
          In addition, I become familiar with the various cloud services from AWS, AZURE and the Google platform and with Big Data platform such as Hadoop, 
             Databricks, Kafka and Spark.</p>
