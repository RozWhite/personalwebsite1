      <h3>Age and Gender Predictor App </h3><br>
      <h5 class="project1">About this project</h5>
      <p>This project is about creating a deep learning (DL) end to end flask web app for predciting age and gender. 
        I used deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) which is mainly used for applications in image and 
        speech recognition to build my model on UTKFace dataset. And finally I deployed the model with Flask on localhost and 
        Heroku platform (PaaS).</p>
        <p>UTKFace dataset is a large-scale face dataset with long age span (range from 0 to 116 years old). 
          The dataset consists of over 20,000 face images with annotations of age, gender, and ethnicity. 
          To overcome the challenge of memory limitations, I resized, normalized and descaled the images 
          to single-channel images.</p>

      <h3>AWS Translator App </h3><br>
      <h5 class="project1">About this project</h5>
      <p>This project is about building a translator application with AWS Lambda, Chalice and Boto3. 
        Chalice is a framework for writing serverless apps in python. Chalice enables the creation and maintenance of 
        application backends and their deployment on AWS using Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda. AWS Lamda is a serverless
         compute service for run and execute code and only pay per execution. 
         Boto3 is an AWS Sdk for Python for accessing AWS services. </p>
         <p>The process for the image translator will be:
          An image is read from the S3 bucket via a lambda function. 
          In the next step, this image is passed to the Rekognition service via calling rekognition API. 
          In response, rekognition API returns labels. A function reads the labels and calls Amazon Translate. 
          To speak translated text, Amazon Polly is used with Amazon Translate.

      <h3>Comment Sentiment Analyzer App</h3><br>
      <h5 class="project1">About this project</h5>
      <p>In this NLP project I created a machine learning end to end flask web app for sentiment analysis with VADER. And finally I deployed my App on Heroku. <br>
        Sentiment is defined as the feeling or emotion expressed by the user in the given corpus.
        VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning) is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool that detects polarity within our text.
        This method will give us scores of the following categories: 1. Positive 2. Negative 3. Neutral 4. Compound. <br>

      <h3>Speech Recognition with Hugging's Face Wav2Vec2</h3><br>
      <h5 class="project1">About this project</h5>
      <p>This project is about detecting user voice from microphone and converting the 
        audio to text with Hugging Face's Transformers. The Hugging Face transformers package provide APIs to easily download and train 
        state-of-the-art pretrained models.
        Wav2Vec2 is a popular pre-trained  model that uses self-supervised learning for speech recognition. 
        I used the "patrickvonplaten/wav2vec2-base-100h-with-lm" transformer model in this project, which contains the same 
        Wav2Vec2 checkpoint but has an additional 4-gram language model for boosting Wav2Vec2 with n-grams in transformers.
        For recognize speech input from the microphone I used SpeechRecognition library.

      <h3>My Own Website </h3><br>
      <h5 class="project1">About this project</h5>
      <p>In this project, I created my own website using Node.js and Express and deployed it on Heroku. Node Js is the 
        runtime environment for running JavaScript on standalone machines and browser. Express, is a backend web application 
        framework for Node.js and offers a lot of tools which make writting node apps more easier. For the frontend I used CSS and Bootstrap, 
        a flexible and powerful frontend framework.
